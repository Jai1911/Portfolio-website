            <img src="your_profile_picture_url.jpg" alt="Profile Picture" class="profile-picture">
            <p>
                I am currently a sophomore at Manipal University Jaipur, pursuing my B.Tech in Computer Science and Engineering with a specialization in IoT & Intelligent Systems.
            </p>
            <p>
                Technology has always been an area of interest for me, and I am dedicated to learning the new evolving tech through hands-on learning and working on real-time projects. Throughout my 3rd semester in college, I learned Data Structure algorithms and Object-Oriented Programming in C and Java, respectively.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have completed multiple courses in programming languages, such as Java foundation through Oracle Academy.
            </p>
            <p>
                Apart from programming, I have also done research on Data Communication Systems and have recently published a research article on 'Latency Reduction Techniques in High-Speed Data Networks' in the IJERT journal.
            </p>
            <p>
                Currently, my interests lie in exploring the data analytics domain, learning new analytical tools, and understanding the mathematical logic behind them.

                <h3>OpenAI quizzer</h3>
                <p>This is a basic quiz bot developed using Tkinter as the GUI and 
                    OpenAI's api key for getting the answers. This was one of my first projects based on using api keys.
                Along with this I have also learned API desgin. There is no demo for this project as the api key is free to use
            only for a limited time.</p>

                <h3>Travel rate comparison platform</h3>
                <p>This is a platform developed to ease the process of viewing all the travel rates while choosing
                    the ideal mode of transport. This platform first asks the user for the destination and then displays the prices
                    for all available travel modes .ie. Flights, Trains, Bus, Car, all at the same time. This helps the user
                    to choose more efficiently.
                </p>  
                   <p> Currently this platform has 2 versions:
                     Version 1: There is a pre-defined databse with 30 major cities and a defined 
                    origin (Jaipur), this was developed to show the working of the platform and does not show real-time prices.
                   </p> 
                   <p> Version 2: This version does not have any pre-defined database and web-scraping tools are used to fetch the
                    real-time data. However web-scraping is not ethical and we are in the process of searching for a work-around by using
                    API keys if they are available.
                    The front-end work for creating a GUI is currently in progress.

                <h3>Ping-Pong game</h3>
                <p>This is the famous ping-pong game, that I developed using Object oriented programming.
                    I have made it so that 2 people can play against each other, using W A S D and arrow keys.
                    This is one of the best ways to implemet OOP.
                </p>
                    <p>Github doesn't allow large clips to be viwed, so to view the demo just click 'view raw' on the page and you 
                    can easily view it. For demo purpose the score count is set to 3 for winning, but this can be changed at users' will.
